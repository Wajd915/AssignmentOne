# Text Summarization with Hugging Face and Gradio

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library for text summarization, integrated with the Gradio library to provide an interactive web interface.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase the capabilities of the Hugging Face text-to-text pipeline for summarization and to provide an interactive way for users to experiment with text summarization via a web interface. 

### Main Files
Hugging_Face_Text_to_Text_Pipeline.ipynb: A notebook demonstrating the integration of Hugging Face's text-to-text pipeline without Gradio. 
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages (transformers and gradio) for running the project.
README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project, instructions, and other relevant information.
How the Hugging Face Text-to-Text Pipeline Works
Loading the Model: The Hugging Face Transformers library provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. In this project, we use the facebook/bart-large-cnn model for summarization.

### Summarization Function: 

The text-to-text pipeline takes an input text and generates a summary. The summarization function uses the pre-trained model to produce concise summaries.

### Gradio Interface: 
The Gradio library creates a web-based interface that allows users to interact with the summarization function. Users can input text into the interface and receive a summarized version in real-time.


The notebook includes a Gradio interface that will be launched automatically when you run the relevant cell. Follow the prompts to enter text and receive summaries.

### Expected Output from the Gradio Interface:

When using the Gradio interface, you should see:

Input Field: A text box where you can enter or paste your text.
Output Field: The summarized version of the input text, generated by the model.
For example, if you input a long paragraph, the interface will display a concise summary based on the model's output.
